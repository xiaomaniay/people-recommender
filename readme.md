# BAMBU Backend Engineer Test

With a data in this repo, build an API that sends 10 potential investor similar with a person described in the query parameters.

- the endpoint is exposed at `people-like-you`
- each of the terms in the query parameters is optional
- the endpoint returns a JSON response with an array of scored suggested matches
    - the suggestions are sorted by descending score
    - each suggestion has a score between 0 and 1 indicating confidence in the suggestion (1 is most confident)

#### Sample responses
